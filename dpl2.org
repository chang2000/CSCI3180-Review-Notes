* Local Declaration
From the formula od Heron:
Area = sqrt(p(p-a)(p-b)(p-c)), p = (a + b + c)/2
Why we should write like this, instead of using (a+b+c)/2 inside the sqrt.??
** Reasons:
*** Messy
*** repeated calculation
** Pay attentation to the data type here!> real or int
* User-Defined Types

One kind is enumeratoin type:

datatype DIRECTION = North | East | South | West;
datatype DIRECTION
con East: 
...
> con means constructor
> All capitalize is convention
* case Expression
